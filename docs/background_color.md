- `cs-background-is-primary`
- `cs-background-is-secondary`
- `cs-background-is-yellow`
- `cs-background-is-red`
- `cs-background-is-orange`
- `cs-background-is-purple`
- `cs-background-is-grey`
- `cs-background-is-black`
- `cs-background-is-white`

## Example

<div class="cs-background-is-white">
    ...
</div>
```
